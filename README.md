I’d explore this academic study and dataset they conducted for 100k children and their parents, which researched the correlation between children’s academic ability and their parents’ income and educational background. 

The study was conducted by researchers under the commission of the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan. 


## Reporting plan
- 1) All the datasets in this study are in the PDF file thus scraping with Python (Tika or other relevant tools) is needed. 

- 2) Based on the data in the study, using regression analysis and see what factor(s) affect children’s academic ability the most/ least. 

- 3) Interviewing authors and other experts with knowledge of this issue.
